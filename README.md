# 👋 Welcome to Aecrarion

**Hi, I'm Abigail Thomas** — a frontend-focused developer and digital worldbuilder.  
I create immersive fantasy experiences, elegant UIs, and tools that bring stories to life.

🧬 I build under the name **Auren Velis**, curator of the world of **Aecrarion** —  
a rich, interactive universe blending storytelling, design, and web technology.

## 🧭 Vision

I believe in creating tools that don’t just function — they **feel**. Whether I'm developing UIs or mythologies,  
my goal is always the same: to build experiences that invite curiosity, clarity, and wonder.
